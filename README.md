## About the Video Course
Google's Dart appears to be a much more robust framework, superseding JavaScript in several aspects to create next-generation apps.
This video starts by setting up a development environment for Dart and Flutter from which to build your first app. You will then learn how to create variables and perform operations and will learn about conditional statements. Next, you will focus on Object-Oriented Programming aspects, wherein you will learn about creating classes, functions, and data structures. You will learn to build a TO-Do list application by calling APIs to get JSON data. Finally, you will learn how to deploy your app on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
By the end of this video, you will be well-acquainted with Dart and Flutter and will be able to create your own amazing applications and show them to the World.
